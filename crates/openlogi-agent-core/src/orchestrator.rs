//! Headless runtime state owned by the background agent.
//!
//! This is the agent-side counterpart to the GUI's `AppState` runtime half,
//! stripped of every UI-only concern (asset resolution, display names, the
//! DPI/SmartShift read caches, the carousel). It owns the shared `Arc`s the
//! CGEventTap hook and the HID++ gesture watcher read, and rebuilds them from a
//! [`Config`] plus the latest device inventory.
//!
//! Unlike the GUI, the agent never runs lazy DPI-capability discovery, so
//! [`DpiCycleState::capabilities`] stays `None` and presets cycle at their raw
//! (still valid) values — exactly the GUI's "window never opened" behaviour.
