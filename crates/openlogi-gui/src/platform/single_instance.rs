//! Cross-platform single-instance process guard.
//!
//! On startup we try to acquire an exclusive, non-blocking lock on a known
//! file under the user's data dir. Holding the lock keeps a second invocation
//! from opening a duplicate window. The lock is automatically released by the
//! OS when the process exits — crash-recovery is free: the next launch
//! reclaims the lock on the leftover file without any cleanup ceremony.
